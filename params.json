Back last October, this website was merely a hypothetical idea, inspired by a friend. I wanted to eventually create a site; however, I didn't know much about web design or coding in general. My start in coding was propelled by CodeAcademy. After their free, online lessons I learned what HTML and CSS were.<br><br>\r\n\r\n However, I learned the most from my introductory web design course which I took my final semester in school. Thanks to my professor, classmates, and friends, I gained a lot of experience and was able to construct bigger and better websites. As I'm not an expert in coding yet, this website isn't a finished product; it's merely a work in progress. It's a portfolio of my academic and professional accomplishments and experiences for interested, potential employers to browse through. <br><br>\r\n\r\nFurthermore as a writer with a book in the making, I'm catering this portfolio also to readers who may wish to learn more about me. Thus, there's sections of this site dedicated to my personal life. For those of you who have stuck it this far, thank you for taking the time to read. I hope you enjoy your time spent on my website and have a pleasant day. \r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</center></div>\r\n<div class=\"bottom\">\r\n\r\n<center><table border=\"5px\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"nwebsite2.html\">Resume</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"nwebsite3.html\">Personal Life</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nate-eom-6b3039a1?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile_pic\">My LinkedIn</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"https://neom500.wordpress.com/\">My WordPress</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"mailto:n_eom@yahoo.com\">Email me @ n_eom@yahoo.com</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</center></div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>",
