<tr>
<td>Nate Eom, born and raised in the DC Metropolitan Area, thirsts for knowledge and good eats. 
<ul>
<li>While he loves the area, he despises the sporadic spontaneity of the weather</li>
<li>He cherishes many different types of food and is open to trying new food</li>
<li>Some of his favorite food include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Korean BBQ</li>
<li>Chipotle</li>
<li>Afghan cuisine</li>
<li>Decadent burgers and fries</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<tr>
<td>However, his passion isn't solely limited to eats; he loves the Humanities in general. He chose English due to its emphasis on reading and writing. He's currently finished with a third of his novel, which is composed up of several fictitious, short stories. Aside from working on his book, he spends time writing miscellaneous pieces on his WordPress, linked below.  While he favors both reading and writing, his bias lies with writing stories rather than reading them.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>As a former editor for Volition, Mason's Literary &amp; Arts magazine, Nate was able to successfully satiate his infatuation by reading and reviewing submitted entries. His position as editor served as a nice counterbalance for the more technical aspects of his concentration, Writing and Rhetoric.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aside from reading, writing, and eating, he preoccupies the remainder of his time working out, dancing, exploring new and familiar cities, volunteering, meeting new people and socializing with old friends.
