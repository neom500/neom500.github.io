<td>However, his passion isn't solely limited to eats; he loves the Humanities in general. He chose English due to its emphasis on reading and writing. He's currently finished with a third of his novel, which is composed up of several fictitious, short stories. Aside from working on his book, he spends time writing miscellaneous pieces on his WordPress, linked below.  While he favors both reading and writing, his bias lies with writing stories rather than reading them.

<td>Aside from reading, writing, and eating, he preoccupies the remainder of his time working out, dancing, exploring new and familiar cities, volunteering, meeting new people and socializing with old friends.
